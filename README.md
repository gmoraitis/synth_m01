# Tone.js Synth Application M01
For my educational path for Javascript

## Overview
This Tone.js Synth Application (M-01) is a versatile web-based synthesizer built using the Tone.js library. It allows users to create and manipulate sounds using 2 monophonic synthesizers simulationaly, a filter , and  4 effects. The app provides an interactive interface to play notes, adjust sound parameters, and apply various audio effects in real-time.

## Play Notes: 
Use the on-screen keyboard or your computer keyboard to play notes. The keys correspond to musical notes (e.g., 'A' for C4, 'W' for C#4).

## Adjust Controls: 
Use the various sliders and dropdowns to adjust the ADSR envelope, filter parameters, waveform type, and effects settings.

# Stop the Synthesizer: 
Click the "Stop" button to stop all sounds and reset the synthesizer.

## Controls
# Keyboard:
